# zomato-analysis

## The storyline
With Bengaluru being the IT capital of India which has one of the most diverse and young population among all of Indian cities. As a result, the restaurant business in Bengaluru is also growing at a healthy pace.
With total number of restaurants exceeding 12000, cuisines  of various countries is readily available at various price points across all of Bengaluru.
As Bengaluru is a young city and its working population comprises overwhelmingly of young working class people, many of the people in Bengaluru are mainly dependent on online food and tiffin services.
The food being served in a locality showcases the uniqueness, diversity and taste of the population.
The pattern in food can also be used to analyze and know more about history, traditions, demography and, even the migartion pattern of the population residing in that area.

With this project, i intend to showcase varied flavour profile across all of Bengaluru like in which locality of Bengaluru North/South Indian food is preferred in general or in which areas vegetarian food or no vegetarian food is preferred.
By analyzing zomato orders, i also intend to analyze the restaurant service pattern too like the location of the different restaurants and what kind of food they serve, the cost factor etc.
I have analyzed and showed what are the most famous restaurant chains/outlets in the IT city(according to the number of restaurants).
and also the % of restaurants accepting/ not accepting online orders with help of pie chart and pandas.
